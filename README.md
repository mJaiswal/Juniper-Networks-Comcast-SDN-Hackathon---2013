Juniper-Networks-Comcast-SDN-Hackathon---2013
=============================================

CHALLENGE STATEMENT
=====================

Scenario 1.   ½ day  (Visualize)
Create view of the network topology and client/serving infrastructure (to be built in Sphere) and develop a mechanism for evaluating and trending performance statistics and bandwidth.

Scenario 2.     Day 2 (Sunny Day – Static traffic conditions)
Create a Controller that will allow a content source to leverage the best performing capacity/segment, for the traffic, to a destination.

Scenario 3.     Day 3 (Stormy Day - Variable traffic conditions)
With the introduction of variable traffic conditions, the Controller must reconfigure the Scenario 2 flow so that it will leverage the best, unused capacity at all times  (without performance impact). 
Use the Visualization techniques to demonstrate effects of change on different traffic flows.

Scenario 4.  Stretch: 
Nailed Scenario 3 .. Let’s talk!!
